## Plagiarism Policy
Submissions must be your own work. Do not copy from other students, solution repositories, or past cohorts. Sharing or copying answers is not allowed. Violations may result in your submission being invalidated or in follow-up under the program’s policies.

## AI Usage Disclaimer
You may use AI tools to study and to clarify concepts, but the commands and code you submit must be written by you. Do not paste in AI-generated answers as your submission. The exercises are for your learning; relying on AI to produce answers will undermine that and may be treated like other academic misconduct.

## Why These Restrictions?
These rules are in place so that you actually practice using Bitcoin CLI, build real skills, and can be fairly assessed. Doing the work yourself is how you learn; shortcuts defeat the purpose of the exercises and don’t prepare you for what comes next in the program.
